üîó **BigQuery Dataset**: [Link](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?ws=!1m7!1m6!12m5!1m3!1suni-sql-project-1!2sus-central1!3s8d7a2346-c3a7-4a38-81eb-b93b49c60eeb!2e1)


## 1. Project Overview
- This project utilizes the AdventureWorks dataset developed by Microsoft, which simulates the operations of a company specializing in manufacturing and distributing bicycles, accessories, and related equipment. The dataset includes multiple tables that reflect core aspects of a business such as sales, production, inventory management, customers, and human resources.
- The queries are designed to analyze sales performance, units sold, year-over-year growth, the effectiveness of discount programs, customer behavior over time (cohort analysis), as well as inventory trends and the relationship between stock levels and consumption.
